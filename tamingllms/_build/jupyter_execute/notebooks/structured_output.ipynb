    "\n",
    "Obtaining structured output from LLMs presents several significant challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inconsistency**: LLMs often produce unpredictable results, sometimes generating well-structured output and other times deviating from the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lack of Type Safety**: LLMs do not inherently understand data types, which can lead to errors when their output is integrated with systems requiring specific data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prompt Engineering Complexity**: Crafting prompts that effectively guide LLMs to produce the correct structured output is complex and requires extensive experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Several strategies and tools can be employed to address the challenges of structured output from LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Schema Guidance**: Providing the LLM with a clear schema or blueprint of the desired output structure helps to constrain its generation and improve consistency. This can be achieved by using tools like Pydantic to define the expected data structure and then using that definition to guide the LLM's output. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Output Parsing**: When LLMs don't natively support structured output, parsing their text output using techniques like regular expressions or dedicated parsing libraries can extract the desired information. For example, you can use regular expressions to extract specific patterns from the LLM's output, or you can use libraries like Pydantic to parse the output into structured data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type Enforcement**: Using tools that enforce data types, such as Pydantic in Python, can ensure that the LLM output adheres to the required data formats. This can help to prevent errors when integrating the LLM's output with other systems."

    "JSON mode is a feature provided by most LLM API providers, such as OpenAI, that allows the model to generate output in JSON format. This is particularly useful when you need structured data as a result, such as when parsing the output programmatically or integrating it with other systems that require JSON input. As depicted in {numref}`json-mode`, JSON mode is implemented by instructing theLLM model to use JSON as response format and optionally defining a target schema.\n",

    "When using JSON mode with OpenAI's API, it is recommended to instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string \"JSON\" does not appear somewhere in the context.\n",

    "Outlines {cite}`outlines2024` is a library specifically focused on structured text generation from LLMs. Under the hood, Outlines works by adjusting the probability distribution of the model's output logits - the raw scores from the final layer of the neural network that are normally converted into text tokens. By introducing carefully crafted logit biases, Outlines can guide the model to prefer certain tokens over others, effectively constraining its outputs to a predefined set of valid options. This provides fine-grained control over the model's generation process. In that way, Outlines provides several powerful features:\n",

    "### Ongoing Debate on LLMs Structured Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of structured output, like JSON or XML, for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a developing area. While structured output offers clear benefits in parsing, robustness, and integration, there is growing debate on whether it also potentially comes at the cost of reasoning abilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research \"Let Me Speak Freely? A Study on the Impact of Format Restrictions on Performance of Large Language Models\" {cite}`tam2024letspeakfreelystudy` suggests that imposing format restrictions on LLMs might impact their performance, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks. Further evidence {cite}`aider2024codejson` suggests LLMs may produce lower quality code if they’re asked to return it as part of a structured JSON response, in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Potential performance degradation:**  Enforcing structured output, especially through constrained decoding methods like JSON-mode, can negatively impact an LLM's reasoning abilities. This is particularly evident in tasks that require multi-step reasoning or complex thought processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overly restrictive schemas:** Imposing strict schemas can limit the expressiveness of LLM outputs and may hinder their ability to generate creative or nuanced responses.  In certain cases, the strictness of the schema might outweigh the benefits of structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increased complexity in prompt engineering:** Crafting prompts that effectively guide LLMs to generate structured outputs while maintaining performance can be challenging. It often requires careful consideration of the schema, the task instructions, and the desired level of detail in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, those findings are not without criticism. The .txt team challenges the work of {cite}`tam2024letspeakfreelystudy`. The rebuttal argues that **structured generation, when done correctly, actually *improves* performance**.\n",

    "*   The prompts used for structured generation, particularly in JSON-mode, didn't provide the LLM with sufficient information to properly complete the task. \n",
    "*   The paper conflates \"structured generation\" with \"JSON-mode\", when they are not the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while .txt provides a compelling and verifiable argument in favor of (proper) structured output generation in LLMs further research and exploration are needed to comprehensively understand the nuances and trade-offs involved in using structured output for various LLM tasks and applications.\n",

    "In summary, the debate surrounding structured output highlights the ongoing challenges in balancing LLM capabilities with real-world application requirements. While structured outputs offer clear benefits in parsing, robustness, and integration, their potential impact on performance, particularly in reasoning tasks is a topic of ongoing debate. \n",
