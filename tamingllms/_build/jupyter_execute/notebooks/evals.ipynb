    "# Challenges of Evaluating LLM-based Applications\n",

    "## Non-Deterministic Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental challenges when building products with Large Language Models (LLMs) is their non-deterministic nature. Unlike traditional software systems where the same input reliably produces the same output, LLMs can generate different responses each time they're queried - even with identical prompts and input data. This characteristic is both a strength and a significant engineering challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask ChatGPT or any other LLM the same question multiple times, you'll likely get different responses. This isn't a bug - it's a fundamental feature of how these models work. The \"temperature\" parameter, which controls the randomness of outputs, allows models to be creative and generate diverse responses. However, this same feature makes it incredibly difficult to build reliable, testable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a financial services company using LLMs to generate investment advice. The non-deterministic nature of these models means that:\n",
    "- The same market data could yield different analysis conclusions\n",
    "- Testing becomes exceedingly more complex compared to traditional software\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance becomes challenging to guarantee\n",
    "- User trust may be affected by inconsistent responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature and Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary source of non-determinism in LLMs comes from their sampling strategies. During text generation, the model:\n",
    "1. Calculates probability distributions for each next token\n",
    "2. Samples from these distributions based on temperature settings\n",
    "3. Uses techniques like nucleus sampling to balance creativity and coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Temperature Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temperature = 0: Most deterministic, but potentially repetitive\n",
    "- Temperature = 1: Balanced creativity and coherence\n",
    "- Temperature > 1: Increased randomness, potentially incoherent"

    "This simple experiment reveals a fundamental challenge in LLM evaluation: even a simple parameter like temperature can dramatically alter model behavior in ways that are difficult to systematically assess. At temperature 0.0, responses are consistent but potentially too rigid. At 1.0, outputs become more varied but less predictable. At 2.0, responses can be wildly different and often incoherent. This non-deterministic behavior makes traditional software testing approaches inadequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implications for evaluation are profound. How can one effectively test an LLM-powered system when the same prompt can yield radically different outputs based on a single parameter? Traditional testing relies on predictable inputs and outputs, but LLMs force us to grapple with probabilistic behavior. While lower temperatures may seem safer for critical applications, they don't eliminate the underlying uncertainty - they merely mask it. This highlights the need for new evaluation paradigms that can handle both deterministic and probabilistic aspects of LLM behavior.\n"

    "## Emerging Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond their non-deterministic nature, LLMs present another fascinating challenge: emergent abilities that spontaneously arise as models scale up in size. These abilities - from basic question answering to complex reasoning - aren't explicitly programmed but rather emerge \"naturally\" as the models grow larger and are trained on more data. This makes evaluation fundamentally different from traditional software testing, where capabilities are explicitly coded and can be tested against clear specifications.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " {numref}`emerging-properties` provides a list of emergent abilities of large language models and the scale. The relationship between model scale and emergent abilities follows a fascinating non-linear pattern. Below certain size thresholds, specific abilities may be completely absent from the model - it simply cannot perform certain tasks, no matter how much you try to coax them out. However, once the model reaches critical points in its scaling journey, these abilities can suddenly manifest in what researchers call a phase transition - a dramatic shift from inability to capability. This unpredictable emergence of capabilities stands in stark contrast to traditional software development, where features are deliberately implemented and can be systematically tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implications for evaluation are profound. While conventional software testing relies on stable test suites and well-defined acceptance criteria, LLM evaluation must contend with a constantly shifting landscape of capabilities. What worked to evaluate a 7B parameter model may be completely inadequate for a 70B parameter model that has developed new emergent abilities. This dynamic nature of LLM capabilities forces us to fundamentally rethink our approach to testing and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a practical example that illustrates these challenges: building a customer support chatbot powered by an LLM. In traditional software development, you would define specific features (like handling refund requests or tracking orders) and write tests to verify each function. But with LLMs, you're not just testing predefined features - you're trying to evaluate emergent capabilities like understanding context, maintaining conversation coherence, and generating appropriate emotional responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fundamental difference raises critical questions about evaluation:\n",
    "- How do we measure capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed?\n",
    "- How can we ensure consistent performance when abilities may suddenly emerge or evolve?\n",
    "- What metrics can capture both the technical accuracy and the subjective quality of responses?\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge becomes even more complex when we consider that traditional software evaluation methods simply weren't designed for these kinds of systems. We need new frameworks that can account for both the deterministic aspects we're used to testing and the emergent properties that make LLMs unique. Let's explore how LLM evaluation differs from traditional software testing across several key dimensions:\n",
    "- **Capability Assessment vs Functional Testing**: Traditional software testing validates specific functionality against predefined requirements. LLM evaluation must assess not necessiraly pre-defined \"emergent properties\" like reasoning, creativity, and language understanding that extend beyond explicit programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metrics and Measurement Challenges**: While traditional software metrics can usually be precisely defined and measured, LLM evaluation often involves subjective qualities like \"helpfulness\" or \"naturalness\" that resist straightforward quantification. Even when we try to break these down into numeric scores, the underlying judgment remains inherently human and context-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Contamination**: Traditional software testing uses carefully crafted test cases with known inputs and expected outputs (e.g., unit tests, integration tests). In contrast, LLMs trained on massive internet-scale datasets risk having already seen and memorized evaluation examples during training, which can lead to artificially inflated performance scores. This requires careful dataset curation to ensure test sets are truly unseen by the model and rigorous cross-validation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benchmark Evolution**: Traditional software maintains stable test suites over time. LLM benchmarks continuously evolve as capabilities advance, making longitudinal performance comparisons difficult and potentially obsoleting older evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human Evaluation Requirements**: Traditional software testing automates most validation. LLM evaluation may demand significant human oversight to assess output quality, appropriateness, and potential biases through structured annotation and systematic review processes.\n",

    "First, it's important to make a distinction between evaluating an LLM versus evaluating an LLM-based application (our focus). While the latter offers foundation capabilities and are typically general-purpose, the former is more specific and tailored to a particular use case. Here, we define an LLM-based application as a system that uses one or more LLMs to perform a specific task. More specifically, an LLM-based application is the combination of one or more LLM models, their associated prompts and parameters to solve a particular business problem.\n",

LLMs are usually evaluated based on their capabilities, which include things like language understanding, reasoning and knowledge.
